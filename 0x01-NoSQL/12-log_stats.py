'''Write a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB:

Database: logs
Collection: nginx
Display (same as the example):
first line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
second line: Methods:
5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s a tabulation before each line)
one line with the number of documents with:
method=GET
path=/status'''


from pymongo import MongoClient

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = MongoClient('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017')

    count = logs.count_documents({})
    print(f"{count} logs")

    methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]
